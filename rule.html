    <li>Nomenclature: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and modules to improve the readability of your code.</li>
    <li>Testing: Before uploading a script, it should be tested in a development environment to ensure that it works as expected and does not generate errors.</li>
    <li>License: Scripts must be open source and respect copyright.</li>
    <li>Feedback: Script authors should be open to feedback and ready to fix any issues reported by users.</li>
