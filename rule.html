<h1>1. Security: Scripts must be free of vulnerabilities and must not contain malicious or potentially malicious code.</h1>
<h1>2. Nomenclature: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and modules to improve the readability of your code.</h1>
<h1>3. Testing: Before uploading a script, it should be tested in a development environment to ensure that it works as expected and does not generate errors.</h1>
<h1>4. License: Scripts must be open source and respect copyright.</h1>
<h1>5. Feedback: Script authors should be open to feedback and ready to fix any issues reported by users.</h1>
