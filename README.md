## Introduction

Welcome to the **Yantra Launcher Script Hub**, an unofficial project that gathers all LUA scripts created for Yantra Launcher by the community, making them easily accessible to everyone. This README file provides instructions on how to modify the project to add new scripts and manage their downloads.

## add your scripts

if you want to add scripts just create a fork of this and modify `scripts.yaml`

to do that you need to follow thi structure
`scripts:
  - name: "Script 1" 
    url: "https://example.com/path/to/script1.lua"`

`name` is obliviusly the name of the script and `url` is the link to download
